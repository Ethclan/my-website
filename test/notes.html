    <P>JUST DON'T CALL ME LATE FOR A CODE :) DINNER</p>
 </div>
 
<p>i'm curently working on order and unordered list.</p>
    <h2>Here is a perfect example</h2>
<div>
  <ol>
        <li> Learn HTML.</li>
          <ul><li>Elements</li>
              <li>Tags
              <li>Blocks
          </ul>
        <li>Learn css.</li>
        <li>Learn phyton.</li>
        <li>save the world. </li>
       </ol>
    
  <p> Other thing i've seen would be for which elemnts closing tag is optional </P>

  <p>for example for those  <ul>
    <li> (li) and 
    <li>(p)are optional</ul>
  <p> but (ol) and (ul) end tag is mandatorry </p>
 
  <ul type="square">
    <li>Mammals</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>raccoons</li>
        <li>gorillas</li></ol>
        <br>
    <li>Reptiles
      <ol type="a">
        <li>iguanas</li>
        <li>cobras</li>
        <br>
      </ol>
    </li>
      <li>Birds</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>ostriches</li>
        <li>Ravens</li>
      </ol>
     </ul> </p>
<p>identation is good for readbility of code not for the output but inside the code so that programmers can make  organize and easily readble code. </p>

<p style="color: lightcoral;"> TRYING coloring paragraph or styling which is part of css. </p>
<h3>ok so now its time to learn about webpages and url </h3>
<p>first url means <mark>uniform resource locator.</mark></p>
